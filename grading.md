# The Giggle Box Grading Feedback

Great job friends -- likes are actually a pretty complicated thing to get working (especially in vanilla JS) and you did a great job with it. Here are some general notes / comments

-   I have to deduct some points for lack of testing -- I think it would have actually helped a lot for you to have tests on your render functions bc it would have helped you keep those functions pure.
-   I think you have some unused functions in your fetch-utils -- always best to clean those up to avoid confusion in the future
-   The editing in place is really great -- nice work on that. I would maybe add an explicit "edit" button just so the user knows how to edit their jokes
-   Your logo is very cute :)
